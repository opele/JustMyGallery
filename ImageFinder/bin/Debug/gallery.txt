implementation:
Console runner:
- issue with images that are much longer than they are wide
	need to crop at a specific ratio: 200%
alternatively use an image grid that handles variable image height


TODO:
when scrolling modal, check that main page in the background is not scrolling
bug: previous image navigation arrow brigther than next arrow in modal image view






Requirements

must:
Image view:
- easy to close single image (popup on list view) by clicking on background
- when viewing image can navigate left or right to see next (navigateable with arrow keys or mouse click on arrow icon)
- fav image (shortcut for a tag)
List view:
- sort and filter according to: date, tags
- allow to combine tags with and/or logic
- auto load when scrolling down


nice to have:
- allow user to add tag images in addition to predefined tags
- categories (= grouping of tags?)
- two modes: small and medium preview image list view



ideas:
- generate previewes?
 should be server side because (initial) loading would be extremly slow if sending over original and caching icon locally
- use browser cache for storing custom tags

image grid with different sizes
same width on all images but optimised height allows for no gaps / whitespace:

need support for allowing different heights for preview images
